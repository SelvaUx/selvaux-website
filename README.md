## 👤 Overview

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. This repository hosts my portfolio website, showcasing my journey in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)**, **VLSI**, **Embedded Systems**, and **AI Architecture**.

It serves as both a professional profile and a digital laboratory for my experiments.

**Live Site**: [selvaux.in](https://selvaux.in)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The website is architected as a multi-page application with a clear separation of concerns:

- **`/` (Home)**: A concise landing page featuring my "Empire Vision" and guiding principles.
- **`/about`**: Detailed biography, education, and skills matrix.
- **`/projects`**: Showcase of my technical projects and builds.
- **`/lab`**: The experimental wing. A place for prototypes and demos.
  - **🤖 `/lab/saraai`**: **SaraAI** - An offline, intent-based AI behavior simulator.
  - **🎮 `/lab/game-1`**: *(Coming Soon)* Browser-based mini-games.
- **`/blog`**: *(Coming Soon)* Thoughts on tech, engineering, and future realities.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Modern, Dark-Themed UI
- Designed with a "hacker/developer" aesthetic in mind (`#0d1117` GitHub dark theme).
- Custom animations, including a 3D tilt effect on the profile picture.
- Fully responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.

### 2. The Lab: SaraAI 🤖
A standout feature of this portfolio is **SaraAI**, located in `/lab/saraai`. 
- **What it is**: An offline AI behavior engine simulator.
- **Why it matters**: It demonstrates **intent-based system architecture** rather than just wrapping a chatbot API.
- **Tech**: Pure JavaScript, intent pattern matching, confidence scoring.
- **Privay**: Runs 100% locally in the browser.

- **Core**: Semantic HTML5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (CDN for dev, build process planned) + Custom CSS
